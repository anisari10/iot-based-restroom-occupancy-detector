# IoT-based restroom occupancy detector
A Computer Networks course project in a team of three.

We designed and manufactured a touch-based sensor that detects occupancy of any room (specifically, restroom) and sends the status of occupancy through WiFi to a website's database using HTTP protocol. This involved programming a WiFi enabled microcontroller ESP-32 using Arduino IDE, database management, HTTP protocol usage.
